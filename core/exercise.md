# Core Ruby: Exercise

* Create a script that asks for a list of names in comma-separated format: "Nathaniel, John, Bob" _hint: use the ‘gets’ method in Ruby to prompt for input_
* Separate the comma-separated string into an array, then ask for the age of each person. _  hint: use the 'split' method to turn a string into an array_
* Sort by the age, then `puts` the final list. e.g. 

* Nathaniel: 28
*  Bob: 17
*  John: 8
